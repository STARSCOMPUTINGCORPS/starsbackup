I hope you enjoy it.\r\n\r\n\"Hello everyone.  If I could steal your attention away from this wonderful continental breakfast, or as I like to call it, \"the extra two hours of sleep before the keynote speaker.\"  I just wanted to take a few moments to reflect on my first, and certainly not my last trip to the STARS Alliance Celebration.  For those of you who haven\'t met me through the snag-em game, at a session, or in the hot tub at the pool after a long day of meetings, my name is Brian Richards and I am an undergraduate Computer Science major at the University of New Orleans.  This entire conference has been a completely life changing experience for me and I hope it has affected all of you as well.  When I first arrived here at the Hilton, I was very nervous, anxious and even terrified because I did not really know what I was doing or even what I expected to get from what turned out to be the most exciting three days of my Computer Science career.  Although my faculty adviser was unable to attend, I met Marguerite Doman on the first day and she reassured me that everything would be fine and that this was a really laid-back experience.  This really helped with the negative emotions and I would like to extend my personal gratitude to her for making it easier.  After that everything went completely smooth.  I signed up for Evie Powell\'s research project; the snag-em game.  For those of you who did not get a chance to play this year, whether it was because you played before or you just did not know about it, I would highly recommend it for next year.  It is a very fun way to extend you social network and meet new people.  I would like to congratulate Kai Dumont on having the most points, but just know I\'ll be coming after that title next year.  When I first got here I was unsure about going to Graduate school after obtaining my bachelor\'s degree.  Now I can confidently say after listening to the keynote and workshop speakers, that it is now an important career goal for me to accomplish.  I will also take as much of the wonderful information I got from the keynotes and meetings and use it to better the Computer Science department at UNO.  I met alot of very interesting people here and I cannot wait to see all of you at next year\'s Celebration, along with some new faces as well.  Thank you.\"\r\n\r\nSorry it took me a while to get back to you on this, as my Computer Science classes have been very demanding this semester.  Also, I was wondering if I could get some advise from you on internships, as I have a few questions about it.  Thanks for providing so much entertainment at the Night at the Museum and I hope you have a wonderful semester.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nBrian Richards'),(52,122,51,0,'Tiffany Barnes','2011-10-03 16:14:31','RE:STARS Celebration Speech','Thank you Brian!

Carla has run the GameMaker tutorial several times with me. \n\nI\'ve put together some stuff for the maze game tutorial.  It includes project resources, a step by step PDF, as well as a finished version of the game.  Most of my old SPARCS team is familiar with it.  \n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/4gsk3i5nc48umne/pFEy-qa3qX/Game Maker Resources\n\nI would recommend that anyone who is going to go to skim through the tutorial pdf, and try to build the game themselves. It should only take about 10 minutes to become familiar with game maker.  The workshop with the students should take 30-45 minutes, Microsoft should send you more details as the time nears.  Usually I get 3-4 groups of about 25 students who come to do the workshop. One of the things we try to do is give the girls challenges after the tutorial part is over, such as adding bombs, enemies, or some other interactive piece (locked doors etc).\n\nOh yeah, and as far as I know this won\'t be a \"booth\" as one would think, it\'s a separate classroom where the groups will circulate through throughout the day. There is a projector, and computers for all of the students. Internet access if needed, will have to be asked for. In the past we had the GameMaker installer on a flash drive, and installed it on the computers that way.  There is also a shared folder that can be installed to, that the other machines should have access to. \n\nAs far as installation goes, grab GameMaker lite from http://yoyogames.com/gamemaker/download.  The resources folder should be copied and placed on the machines.  We found it easiest if it was on the desktop.  Not all of these students are familiar with things like double clicking and computer navigation.\n\nI think that\'s most of my insider\'s scoop.  Other than what I\'ve mentioned just tell them to have fun and feel free to grab free drinks from the fridge in the hallway, I like making the hot cocoa.
