It was not always easy getting the kids settled in, but when they did settle down and really try to work it was a lot of fun.\n\nMy favorite program from CSDT was the Virtual Bead Loom. I was able to sit with two of the girls and explain what the goals of the programs were. Although they were not particularly interested in the background history, it was great to see the kids grasp new math concepts. Having them create the batman and android pictures was definitely helpful in getting them interested in the activity.\n\nMy least favorite program was the Graffiti Grapher because I did not see the connection with the math lesson and it was more difficult to keep the kids interested.\n\nI would definitely love to work with the Boys & Girls Club again, but I\'d also like to go out to the elementary schools as well.
